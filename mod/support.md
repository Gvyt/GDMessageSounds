Like this mod? Thanks!

If you enjoy using this mod and would like to support its development, consider buying me a coffee! Your support helps keep the mod alive and allows me to continue improving it.
Wait, what do you mean I don't have a Kofi page?
That's right! I dont have one. Instead, because this is open source, fork the repo and make your own version of the mod! That's what I call supporting this mod.


Oh, yeah, or you could just subscribe to my channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GvYoutubeScratch). Also works.
